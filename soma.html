    <h1>Soma</h1>
    
    <p><b>Function:</b> The soma, or cell body, is the control center of the neuron. It contains the nucleus, which houses the cellâ€™s genetic material, and the organelles responsible for protein synthesis and energy production.</p>

    <p><b>Other facts:</b> The soma integrates all incoming signals received by the dendrites and determines if an action potential will be generated and sent down the axon. It plays a critical role in maintaining the health of the neuron by producing essential proteins and enzymes.</p>
