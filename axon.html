    <h1>Axon</h1>

        <p><b>Function:</b> The axon is responsible for transmitting electrical impulses (action potentials) from the neuron's <a href="axon_hillock.html"> axon hillock</a> to the axon terminals where the signal is passed across the <a href="synpase.html"> synapse</a> to other neurons. It acts as the main communication highway for sending information to the next neuron.</p>
    
        <p><b>Cytoskeleton structure:</b> The axon is supported by a network of <a href="cytoskeleton.html">microtubules and neurofilaments</a>. In axons, microtubules are oriented with their plus (+) ends toward the axon terminal, allowing kinesins to transport cargo outward and dyneins to carry materials back toward the cell body (negative direction).</p>
    
        <p><b>Other facts:</b> Each neuron has only <b>one</b> axon, but the axon can branch out to communicate with multiple targets. The end of the axon contains synaptic terminals where signals (known as neurotransmitters) are released to pass signals to the next neuron.</p>
