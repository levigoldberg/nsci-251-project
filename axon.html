        <p><b>Function:</b> The axon is responsible for transmitting electrical impulses (action potentials) from the neuron's cell body (soma) to other neurons or target tissues such as muscles or glands. It acts as the main communication pathway for sending information to the next neuron in a circuit.</p>
    
        <p><b>Cytoskeleton structure:</b> The axon is supported by a network of microtubules and neurofilaments. These structures maintain the axon's shape and facilitate the transport of materials between the soma and the axon terminals, where neurotransmitters are released.</p>
    
        <p><b>Other facts:</b> Each neuron has only <b>one</b> axon, but the axon can branch out to communicate with multiple targets. The end of the axon contains synaptic terminals where neurotransmitters are released to pass signals to the next cell.</p>
