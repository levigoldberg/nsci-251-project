    <h1>Axon</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Function:</b> The axon is a long, slender projection of a neuron
      responsible for transmitting electrical impulses, known as
      <a href="membrane.html">action potentials</a>, from the neuron's
      <a href="axon_hillock.html">axon hillock</a> to the axon terminals. At the
      terminals, the signal is passed across the
      <a href="synapse.html">synapse</a> to other neurons, muscles, or glands.
      The axon serves as the main communication highway for sending information
      efficiently over long distances in the nervous system.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Myelin Sheath:</b> Many axons are wrapped in a protective, insulating
      layer called the <strong>myelin sheath</strong>, which is made up of
      specialized glial cells. The myelin sheath acts as an insulator,
      increasing the speed at which electrical impulses travel down the axon.
      Instead of moving continuously, the action potential "jumps" from one
      unmyelinated gap, known as the <strong>nodes of Ranvier</strong>, to the
      next. This allows signals to travel much faster compared to unmyelinated
      axons.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cytoskeleton Structure:</b> The axon is supported internally by a
      network of
      <a href="cytoskeleton.html">microtubules and neurofilaments</a>.
      Microtubules in the axon are arranged with their plus (+) ends toward the
      axon terminal, allowing molecular motors like kinesins to transport
      cellular cargo outward, while dyneins transport cargo back toward the cell
      body in the negative direction. This transport system ensures the
      efficient movement of materials such as proteins, vesicles, and organelles
      within the axon.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Other Facts:</b> Each neuron typically has only
      <strong>one</strong> axon, but this axon can branch into multiple
      terminals to communicate with other neurons (or itself!). The axon
      terminal contains synaptic vesicles that release neurotransmitters, the
      chemical signals that pass the electrical signal across the synapse to the
      next neuron.
