    <h1>Dendrite</h1>

    <p><b>Function:</b> Dendrites receive signals from other neurons and convey this information to the neuron's soma. They act as the main input structures of the neuron, gathering and integrating incoming signals.</p>

    <p><b>Structure:</b> Dendrites are often covered with small protrusions called dendritic spines, which form synapses with the axons of other neurons. These spines increase the surface area available for receiving synaptic input.</p>

    <p><b>Other facts:</b> A neuron can have many dendrites, which allows it to receive input from numerous other neurons simultaneously. Dendrites play a crucial role in determining the strength and integration of the signals received by the neuron.</p>

    <p><b>Growth Cones:</b> Growth cones are dynamic, actin-rich structures located at the tips of developing dendrites (and axons). They are responsible for guiding dendrites toward their appropriate targets during development and synaptic formation. Growth cones explore the extracellular environment and respond to chemical signals, helping the neuron make the correct connections.</p>
