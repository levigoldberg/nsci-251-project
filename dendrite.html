    <p><b>Function:</b> Dendrites receive signals from other neurons and convey this information to the neuron's soma. They act as the main input structures of the neuron, gathering and integrating incoming signals.</p>

    <p><b>Structure:</b> Dendrites are often covered with small protrusions called dendritic spines, which form synapses with the axons of other neurons. These spines increase the surface area available for receiving synaptic input.</p>

    <p><b>Other facts:</b> A neuron can have many dendrites, which allows it to receive input from numerous other neurons simultaneously. Dendrites play a crucial role in determining the strength and integration of the signals received by the neuron.</p>
