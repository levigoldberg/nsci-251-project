    <h1>Axon Hillock</h1>

    <h3>1. Action Potential Propagation</h3>
    <p>The <strong>axon hillock</strong> is the region where the cell body transitions into the axon and is crucial for initiating an <strong>action potential</strong>. This area contains a much higher concentration of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels compared to other parts of the neuron, making it highly sensitive to changes in membrane potential. When the membrane at the axon hillock becomes sufficiently depolarized—reaching a threshold of around -55 mV—these voltage-gated channels open, allowing sodium ions to rush in. This triggers a wave of depolarization that propagates along the axon toward the terminal, resulting in the transmission of the signal. To learn more about how the membrane plays a role in this process, visit the <a href="membrane.html">Membrane Page</a>. After the depolarization phase, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels open to restore the resting membrane potential.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Refractory Period</h3>
    <p>Following an action potential, the membrane enters a <strong>refractory period</strong>, during which it becomes less responsive to stimuli. This ensures that the action potential travels in only one direction toward the axon terminal, preventing backward propagation.</p>
