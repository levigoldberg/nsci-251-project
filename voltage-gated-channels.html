      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Voltage-gated ion channels are a type of ion channel that open or close in response to changes in the electrical potential (voltage) across the membrane. These channels are essential for generating and propagating electrical signals in neurons, such as the action potential, and play a crucial role in excitable cells like muscle and nerve cells.</p>
  
      <h2>How They Work</h2>
      <p>Voltage-gated ion channels are proteins embedded in the cell membrane. They have voltage-sensing domains that detect changes in membrane potential. When the membrane depolarizes to a certain threshold, the channels change conformation, allowing specific ions (such as sodium, potassium, or calcium) to flow in or out of the cell.</p>

      <p>Hereâ€™s a general breakdown of their function:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Resting State:</strong> When the neuron is at rest, the voltage-gated ion channels are closed, and no ions pass through.</li>
          <li><strong>Depolarization:</strong> A change in the membrane potential causes the voltage-sensing domains to shift, opening the channels and allowing ions to flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Repolarization:</strong> After the ions flow, the membrane potential is restored, and the channels close again, returning to their resting state.</li>
      </ul>
