      <h2>Membrane Changes During Signal Transmission</h2>
      <p>The neuron membrane undergoes several changes to relay information from one part of the neuron to the axon terminal. These changes primarily involve electrical signaling, known as the <strong>action potential</strong>. Key properties of the membrane that change include:</p>
  
      <h3>1. Membrane Potential</h3>
      <p>The <strong>membrane potential</strong> refers to the difference in electrical charge across the neuronal membrane. At rest, the inside of the neuron is negatively charged compared to the outside, creating a <strong>resting membrane potential</strong> of about -70 mV. This potential is maintained by the activity of the sodium-potassium pump and ion channels.</p>
  
      <h3>2. Ion Permeability</h3>
      <p>The membrane's permeability to ions, particularly sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), changes rapidly during signaling. <a href="voltage-gated-channels.html">Voltage-gated ion channels</a> open in response to changes in membrane potential. Sodium ions rush into the neuron, causing <strong>depolarization</strong>, while potassium ions exit to restore the resting potential in a process known as <strong>repolarization</strong>.</p>
  
      <h3>5. Myelination and Saltatory Conduction</h3>
      <p>In myelinated neurons, the membrane's properties change at the <strong>nodes of Ranvier</strong>. The myelin sheath insulates the axon, speeding up electrical signals through <strong>saltatory conduction</strong>, where the action potential jumps from node to node, increasing the efficiency of signal transmission.</p>
