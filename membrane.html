      <h2>Membrane Changes During Signal Transmission</h2>
      <p>The neuron membrane undergoes several changes to relay information from one part of the neuron to the axon terminal. These changes primarily involve electrical signaling, known as the <strong>action potential</strong>. Key properties of the membrane that change include:</p>
  
      <h3>1. Membrane Potential</h3>
      <p>The <strong>membrane potential</strong> refers to the difference in electrical charge across the neuronal membrane. </p>
      <p>At rest, the inside of the neuron is negatively charged compared to the outside, creating a <strong>resting membrane potential</strong> of about -70 mV. This potential is maintained by the activity of the sodium-potassium pump and ion channels.</p>
      <p>This is due to the uneven distribution of ions, with more potassium (K+) inside and more sodium (Na+) outside the cell. The membrane is more permeable to K+, allowing it to leave the cell, creating a negative charge inside. </p>
  
      <h3>2. Ion Permeability</h3>
      <p>The membrane's permeability to ions, particularly sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), changes rapidly during signaling. <a href="voltage-gated-channels.html">Voltage-gated ion channels</a> open in response to changes in membrane potential. Sodium ions rush into the neuron, causing <strong>depolarization</strong>, while potassium ions exit to restore the resting potential in a process known as <strong>repolarization</strong>.</p>
  
      <h3>Action Potential Chart</h3>
      <img src="action-potential.jpg" alt="Action Potential Chart" class="small-image">
      <p>The <strong>action potential</strong> is a rapid change in the membrane potential that occurs when a neuron sends a signal. The stages of an action potential include:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resting State:</strong> The neuron is at its resting membrane potential (-70 mV), and voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels are closed.</li>
        <li><strong>Depolarization:</strong> When a stimulus reaches the neuron, voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell. This influx of positive charge causes the membrane potential to become more positive.</li>
        <li><strong>Repolarization:</strong> Once the membrane potential reaches its peak (+30 mV), sodium channels close, and voltage-gated potassium channels open. Potassium ions exit the neuron, returning the membrane potential to its resting state.</li>
        <li><strong>Hyperpolarization:</strong> Potassium channels stay open a bit longer than necessary, causing the membrane potential to temporarily dip below the resting potential (more negative).</li>
        <li><strong>Return to Resting State:</strong> The sodium-potassium pump restores the resting potential by actively transporting sodium out of the neuron and potassium into the neuron.</li>
      </ul>
