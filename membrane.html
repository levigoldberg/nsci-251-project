    <p><b>Membrane potential:</b> The membrane of a neuron separates the inside of the cell from the extracellular space, and its potential is crucial for the neuron’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. The membrane potential is the difference in charge across the membrane, created by ions like sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-).</p>

    <p>The neuron’s resting membrane potential is maintained at around -70 mV, primarily due to the movement of K+ out of the cell and the selective permeability of the membrane to different ions. When the neuron receives a signal, the membrane can depolarize (become more positive), triggering an action potential if the threshold is reached.</p>

    <p><b>Other facts:</b> Membrane proteins, such as ion channels and transporters, control the flow of ions in and out of the neuron, which is essential for generating electrical impulses. An image map here can lead to a zoomed-in view of an ion channel, showing how these proteins facilitate ion movement during electrical signaling.</p>
